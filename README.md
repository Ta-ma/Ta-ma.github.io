# Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio in https://ta-ma.github.io/

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start a dev server listening in port 5173.

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

This will build and export the minified files to the docs/ folder. GitHub Pages reads the static app compiled in this folder to display it.
